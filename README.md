# LEADS : Likely Extremely Arbitrary Data Structures

Creating data structures that may be somewhat pointless or arbitrary when compared to the more common data structures we know of.

## Current Data Structures
- [Schrodinger's Stack](https://github.com/dtsivkovski/leads/tree/main/src/schrodingers-stack) - Is there really a value? Pop or peek to find out...
- [World](https://github.com/dtsivkovski/leads/tree/main/src/world) - Vertices in a three-dimensional world.
